# AGENTS.md

MaoTaAgent is a fully plugin-based proxy framework; please read [@docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) before making modifications.

## Repository layout

- `apps/cli/`: the `maota` launcher (`@maota/cli`): entry modes, flags, terminal rendering. Its README owns the command contract.
- `apps/web/`: the web plugin: one HTTP server for both the UI and the host RPC. The UI is `apps/web/ui/`; the component library `MaoTaUI` is an out-of-tree link package.
- `packages/boot/app-boot/`, `packages/boot/host/`: launch glue: which config file and kernel binary one launch uses, and the Node host that drives the kernel over stdio.
- `packages/`, `apps/`: pnpm workspace packages, each with a `package.json` and a `src/index.ts`. `pnpm build` (tsdown) writes `lib/index.js`, which is what the manifest points at and what a kernel spawns; `lib/` is not committed. A plugin is a package a profile's bundles list by name: the kernel resolves that name from the profile's own `node_modules` and spawns it, and never imports it. Two plugins sit one level deeper: `packages/agent/agent-core/` and `packages/boot/hmr/`.
- `packages/bundle/`: the bundles. Each holds the plugin rows one profile mounts, listed by package name, and nothing else.
- `scripts/`: repository-level tooling. `scripts/check.ts` is the check runner `pnpm check` calls; `scripts/tests/` holds the smoke tests that need a real kernel binary.
- `docs/`: architecture, conventions, defensive patterns, and the bilingual-pair checker.
- `$MAOTA_HOME` (default `~/.maota`): one directory per profile under `profiles/`, each holding the generated `eggshell.toml` plugin set and the untracked `eggshell.local.toml` machine layer. Nothing lives in the repository root.

## Commands

- `pnpm build`: tsdown writes every package's `lib/`. `pnpm check` runs it first, so a check always reads the same artifact a kernel spawns.
- `pnpm check`: `scripts/check.ts`: the build, then types, then the bilingual pairs, plugin checks, smokes and the web typecheck, the last group running in parallel. It prints one line per step and dumps the output of whatever failed. Run it before handing work over.
- `MAOTA_CHECK_JOBS=<n>`: how many steps `pnpm check` runs at once, defaults to one less than the core count, capped at six.
- `pnpm check:types`, `pnpm check:plugins`, `pnpm check:config`: the checks one at a time; `check:config` prints a config report without booting.
- `pnpm boot`, `pnpm boot "question"`, `pnpm web`: launch the CLI: interactive or one-shot, then the resident web mode.
- `pnpm cli:smoke`, `pnpm config:smoke`: CLI grammar and config resolution, no kernel needed.
- `pnpm smoke`, `pnpm conversation`, `pnpm hmr:smoke`, `pnpm web:smoke`: smoke tests that need a built eggshell kernel.
- `pnpm i18n:write <x.md>`: re-record a bilingual pair after editing either side.

## Host sandbox failures

If a required gh, pnpm, build, test, or generator command fails because the sandbox blocks credentials, network, IPC, watching, or nested sandbox-exec, retry unchanged with the narrowest host escalation. Require sandbox evidence; never bypass test failures or the product sandbox.

## Conventions

- Explicit is better than implicit; layered decoupling; composition over inheritance; no enforcement, but extension points are provided; there is no monolithic Trainer, but extension mechanisms such as hooks, FX, and distributed support are available.
- Trust TypeScript at typed same-process boundaries. Do not add runtime validation, fallback behavior, or hostile-input tests solely for values the static interface requires; validate at parser/config, queued, model/tool JSON, durable/file, worker, process, and wire boundaries.
- No comments in code. Write one only where the logic is genuinely hard to follow, never to restate what the code already says.

## Documentation

Read [@docs/CONVENTIONS.md](docs/CONVENTIONS.md) before writing or editing any document, README, or language pair; it owns the rules for pairs, README shape, and prose. `pnpm check` enforces the pairs it produces.

## Defensive patterns

Read [@docs/defensive-patterns.md](docs/defensive-patterns.md) before lifecycle, concurrency, subprocess, or teardown work.

## Editing these instructions

`CLAUDE.md` only includes this file; edit `AGENTS.md`. Keep each rule self-contained while linking high-level docs, and condense when clarity survives.
